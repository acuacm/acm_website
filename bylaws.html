						Dear Abilene Christian University ACM Student Chapter,
						<br>
						You have been chartered by ACM's Chief Operating Officer on March
						25, 1980. Below you will find the bylaws under which you will operate
						as an ACM chapter:
					</p>
					
					<h4>Article I: Name</h4>
					<p class="tab article">
						1. This organization shall be called: Abilene Christian University ACM
						Student Chapter. In these Bylaws it is referred to as the Chapter; the
						Association for Computing Machinery is referred to as the ACM.
					</p>
                    
					<h4>Article II: Purpose</h4>
					<p class="tab">
						1. The Chapter is organized and will be operated exclusively for
						educational and scientific purposes to promote the following:
                        </p><p class="tab-2">
							a. An increased knowledge of and greater interest in the science,
							design, development, construction, languages, management and
							applications of modern computing.
							<br>
							b. Greater interest in computing and its applications.
							<br>
							c. A means of communication between persons having an interest in
							computing.
						</p>
						<p class="tab article">

						other interested persons in the Abilene community.
						<br>
						3. The Chapter is chartered by the ACM.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Article III: Membership</h4>
					<p class="tab article">
						The provisions of this section must conform to the membership
						provisions specified in ACM's Bylaws (Bylaw 5, Section 5; ACM
						Constitution Article 3).
						<br>
						1. Membership in the Student Chapter shall be open to all ACM
						members and nonmembers.
						<br>
						2. Voting membership in the Student Chapter shall be granted to all
						active chapter members.
						<br>
						3. Membership shall not be restricted according to race, creed, age,
						gender, disability, nationality, sexual orientation, economic status,
						veteran status, or parenthood.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Article IV: Officers</h4>
					<p class="tab article">

						Treasurer. These individuals must be ACM Student Members. In

						the Chapter's election be held at the last meeting in the fall with the
						new officers taking office in January. This provides for a period of
						transition from the outgoing Council to the incoming Council as well
						as providing continuity of management and planning over the summer.

						timing that serves the same objectives.]
						<br>
						4. Appointment or nomination of an individual to an officer position
						within an ACM chapter shall be in general limited to two full
						consecutive terms in the same position. This recommendation is
						intended to encourage the continuing infusion of new volunteers into
						the organization and to encourage office holders to give thought to
						planning for their successor. Appointment or nomination to a third or
						subsequent consecutive term should be limited to situations where
						such appointment or nomination is believed to be in the best interests
						of the Association.
					</p>
